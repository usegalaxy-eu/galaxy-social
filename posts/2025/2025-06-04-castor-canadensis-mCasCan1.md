ðŸ¦« We are excited to announce the completion of an annotated reference assembly for the North American beaver, Castor canadensis! Ryan Langlois and his lab at the University of Minnesota will use the genome to study mechanisms of virus susceptibility and resistance. ðŸ¦  


ðŸ§¬ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy, and annotation by NCBI. Data available on NCBI's RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_047511655.1/
