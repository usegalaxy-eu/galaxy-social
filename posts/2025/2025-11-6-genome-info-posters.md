If you're at Genome Informatics #GI2025 this week, be sure to stop by the 3 Galaxy posters to chat with Delphine, Mike and Anton about great new things in Galaxy.


While you're drinking you wine, stop by Delphine's poster (91) in poster session I. Did you know you can do genome assembly and annotation in Galaxy? See her poster "Dual curation improves the quality of genome assemblies".


After you talk to Delphine, take a few more steps to Anton's session I poster (112) "Galaxy Filament—Bringing analyses to the data on a global scale," and learn about Filament and it's current implementation in https://BRC-Analytics.org


Before the banquet on Friday, stop by Mike's poster (134, poster session II), "English is the new programming language—Reproducible, transparent and accessible agentic analysis with GalaxyMCP" and talk about how LLMs are making Galaxy analyses easier.


And if you're not at Genome Informatics, of course you can have the conversation about these topics here.
