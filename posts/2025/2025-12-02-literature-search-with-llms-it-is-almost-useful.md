Ran the same literature search through Claude Code and ChatGPT. Found ZERO papers in common despite using identical databases. Both seraches were useful in finding what I need, but lack of overlap was ... slightly concerning.  The lesson: AI tools are powerful but limited. Use multiple approaches for comprehensive surveys and remeber: these things improve FAST! https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-12-2-claude-lit/
