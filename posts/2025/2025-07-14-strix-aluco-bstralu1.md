ü¶â We are excited to announce an annotated genome assembly for the tawny owl (Strix aluco), commonly found in woodlands across Europe, as well as western Siberia. Special thanks to our collaborator Tom Gilbert at the University of Copenhagen!


üß¨ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy, and annotation done by NCBI. Data available on NCBI's RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_031877795.1/
