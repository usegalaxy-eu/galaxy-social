üê¢ As part of the VGP's mission to bolster conservation efforts, we are thrilled to announce the completion of a reference genome for the critically endangered elongated tortoise, Indotestudo elongata. Special thanks to our collaborators at the Bronx Zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society!


üß¨ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy. Data available on NCBI's GenBank: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_050000095.1/
