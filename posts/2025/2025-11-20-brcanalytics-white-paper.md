In case you missed it earlier this week, when we put out the new BRC-Analytis.org release, we released a white paper titled  "From data to publication in a browser with BRC-Analytics: Evolutionary dynamics of coding overlaps in measles virus" (https://gxy.io/brc-measles-whitepaper). This paper walks through the analysis of a public set of measles RNA-seq data all done *for free*  through BRC-Analytics.
