We are pleased to announce a new release of https://BRC-Analytics.org (v0.17.0). This release updates the number of included organisms to 1900+ and over 5000 assemblies from all across the taxonomic spectrum, and more improvements to searching ENA and the workflow config UI.


There is also now a "Learn" section, with an inaugural white paper, "From data to publication in a browser with BRC-Analytics: Evolutionary dynamics of coding overlaps in measles virus" (https://brc-analytics.org/learn/featured-analyses/evolutionary-dynamics-of-coding-overlaps-in-measles)


Of course, if you have organisms/assemblies you'd like to see added, or have suggestions about funtionality, let us know!
