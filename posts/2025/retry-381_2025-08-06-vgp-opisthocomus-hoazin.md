ü™Ω We are excited to announce an annotated genome assembly for the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), found in swamps, riparian forests, and mangroves of the Amazon and the Orinoco basins in South America. Special thanks to our collaborator Andrew Crawford!


üß¨ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy, and annotation done by NCBI. Data available on NCBI's RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_030867145.1/
