üê≠ Thanks to the RefSeq team at NCBI, we now have an annotated genome assembly for the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), found throughout eastern North America! 


üß† Lauren O'Connell and her colleagues at the Stanford Laboratory of Organismal Biology will be using the genome to help answer fundamental questions in neuroscience and physiology.


üß¨ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy, and annotation done by NCBI. Data available on NCBI's RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_037038515.1/
