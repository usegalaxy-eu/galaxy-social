üê∏ We are thrilled to announce an annotated genome assembly for the Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), first described by Charles Darwin during his voyage on HMS Beagle on a trip to Chile. R. darwinii is currently classified as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Special thanks to our collaborators Lucas Vicu√±a, Anibal Velasco, and Claudio Azat for helping us bolster conservation efforts!


üß¨ The genome was sequenced and assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab, with assembly done on Galaxy, and annotation done by NCBI. Data available on NCBI's RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_050947455.1/
