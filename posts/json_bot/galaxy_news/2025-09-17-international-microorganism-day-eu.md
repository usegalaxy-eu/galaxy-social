Microbes—bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea—are invisible to the naked eye, but their impact is everywhere. They shape our health, drive Earth's ecosystems, and even influence the climate. Thanks to Galaxy and the Microbiology Galaxy Lab, researchers worldwide are unlocking the secrets of these microscopic powerhouses, leading to breakthroughs in medicine, ecology, and sustainability.

![This illustration depicts a scientist in a laboratory setting, surrounded by colorful graphical representations of microorganisms and biological elements, emphasizing the field of microbial research and bioinformatics. The scientist, working on a computer displaying data analysis graphs, is framed by various icons including bacteria, viruses, DNA strands, and microbes, symbolizing the diversity of microbial life and genetic study. A magnifying glass focusing on a DNA helix highlights the importance of genomic analysis and sequencing in this research. The overall image conveys the integration of technology and biology to explore and understand microbial ecosystems, genetic information, and their implications for health and science.](https://galaxyproject.org/assets/static/illustration.fd5da49.7f33279c72fd6fec0bc6aef2239ae9ef.png)
![This image presents the Microbiology Galaxy Lab, a platform dedicated to One Health and ecological integrity, illustrating how it connects humans, animals, and the environment through the analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites using 315+ tool suites and 115+ workflows. On the left, it highlights ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity, covering areas such as microbial diversity, interactions, ecosystem modeling, strain discovery, pathway analysis, population omics, and temporal dynamics. On the right, it focuses on health and disease, addressing topics like clinical microbiota, antimicrobial resistance, pathogen profiling (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), virulence assessment, dysbiosis analysis, abundance quantification, outbreak modeling, biomarker correlation, and host interaction. The lab also emphasizes citizen science, education, and 35+ tutorials, promoting accessibility and knowledge sharing in microbiology research.](https://galaxyproject.org/assets/static/microbiology_galaxy_lab.dbb31a9.2c3e692dff6deb870b100766ea5fc589.png)
