NVIDIA Parabricks GPU-accelerated FQ2BAM is now available in Galaxy, bringing FASTQ-to-BAM alignment runtime to just a few minutes for 2.5 GB paired-end human whole-genome datasets. Its runtime is benchmarked against BWA-MEM2 and BWA across five runs and shows that mapping and QC metrics remain essentially identical to CPU-based alignment—while delivering a major speedup for Galaxy workflows.
