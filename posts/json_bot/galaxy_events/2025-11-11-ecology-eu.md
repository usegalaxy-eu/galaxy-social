📣 Galaxy Ecology training and collabroation fest

As colleagues from CCAMLR / Antarctica conservation from Belgium are coming to Concarneau marine station to work on Galaxy Ecology use in their projects, we propose to create an open event, where colleagues from CCAMLR / Antarctica conservation from UK, New Zealand and others are interested to participate remotely, so people wanted to learn how to use and contribute to Galaxy Ecology European Platform during these 3 days.

📍 France
📅 25 November 2025
