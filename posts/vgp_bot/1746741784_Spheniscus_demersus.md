üåç‚ú® Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! We have successfully sequenced the 1.28GB genome of the African Penguin, also known as Spheniscus demersus! üêß This remarkable project not only sheds light on the genetic makeup of this beloved species but also showcases cutting-edge techniques using https://usegalaxy.org for assembly and annotation. Did you know that African Penguins are the only penguin species that breeds in Africa? Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in warm, coastal environments. üåäüï∂Ô∏è We can't wait to explore the insights this genome will provide into their biology and conservation. Stay tuned for more updates! #Genomics #AfricanPenguin #Conservation
