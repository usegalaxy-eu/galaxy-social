![These birds follow a unique mating pattern - white morphs exclusively pair with tan mates and vice versa. This unusual system has earned them the nickname 'the bird with four sexes'](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_3.png)

ðŸŒŸ Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! We've just sequenced the 100MB genome of the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis)! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦… This remarkable bird is known for its striking contrasting plumage and unique vocalizations. What's more, it exhibits fascinating social behavior; some individuals can display dual color morphs, influencing their mating strategies and social interactions. The genome was meticulously assembled and annotated using the powerful tools available at https://usegalaxy.org. This achievement opens up new avenues for understanding not just this species, but avian genetics as a whole. Stay tuned for more insights! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨ #Genomics #Birds #ZonotrichiaAlbicollis
