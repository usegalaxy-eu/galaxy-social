üö® Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! üåü We've successfully sequenced the 1.28GB genome of the African penguin, scientifically known as Spheniscus demersus! üêß‚ú® This important milestone will help us understand this iconic species better and aid in conservation efforts.

Our team used the powerful platform at [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org) for assembly and annotation, ensuring high-quality results. 

Did you know that African penguins are unique for their distinctive "braying" call, which sounds a lot like a donkey? üê¥üí¨ This charming vocalization plays a crucial role in their social interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we dive deeper into their genetics! #AfricanPenguin #Genomics #Conservation üß¨‚ù§Ô∏è
