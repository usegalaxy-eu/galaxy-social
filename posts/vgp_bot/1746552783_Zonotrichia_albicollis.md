![The White-throated Sparrow](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_1.png)
![These birds follow a unique mating pattern - white morphs exclusively pair with tan mates and vice versa. This unusual system has earned them the nickname 'the bird with four sexes'](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_3.png)

üåü Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! We've successfully sequenced the 100MB genome of the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis)! üéâ This incredible achievement was made possible using the powerful tools available at [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org), where we assembled and annotated the genome, unlocking new insights into this fascinating species. 

Did you know that White-throated Sparrows are known for their striking vocalizations and color morphs? Their distinctive song can be heard during spring migrations, and they display two different color phases: tan and white! üê¶ Stay tuned for more updates as we explore the secrets hidden within their genome! #Genomics #ZonotrichiaAlbicollis #VertebrateGenomeLab #Birds
