üåü Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! We‚Äôve successfully sequenced the 1.28GB genome of the African Penguin, also known as Spheniscus demersus! üêß This remarkable species, known for its distinctive black and white plumage and charming waddles, faces conservation challenges due to habitat loss and climate change. 

Our research team utilized https://usegalaxy.org to assemble and annotate this important genome, which will aid in conservation efforts and further our understanding of penguin biology. 

Join us in celebrating this milestone in genomics as we work towards a brighter future for the African Penguin! üêßüíô #Genomics #Conservation #AfricanPenguin
