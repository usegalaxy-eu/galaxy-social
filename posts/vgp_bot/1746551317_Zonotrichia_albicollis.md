![The White-throated Sparrow](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_1.png)
![These birds follow a unique mating pattern - white morphs exclusively pair with tan mates and vice versa. This unusual system has earned them the nickname 'the bird with four sexes'](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_3.png)

üéâ Exciting news from the Vertebrate Genome Lab! We have successfully sequenced the 100MB genome of the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis)! üåü This remarkable project utilized the powerful tools available at https://usegalaxy.org for assembly and annotation. 

Did you know? The White-throated Sparrow has a unique genetic trait that leads to different color morphs‚Äîone with a striking white throat and one with a more muted tone. This fascinating variability plays a role in their mating and social behaviors. üê¶‚ú®

Stay tuned for more updates and insights from this groundbreaking research! #Genomics #BirdResearch #WhiteThroatedSparrow #ZonotrichiaAlbicollis
