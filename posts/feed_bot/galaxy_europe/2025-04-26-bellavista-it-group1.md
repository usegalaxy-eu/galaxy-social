üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-04-26-bellavista-it/

[BellaVista](https://github.com/pkosurilab/BellaVista), a lightweight open-source tool for interactive visualization and exploration of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data,
is now available as an interactive tool in Galaxy.

What is BellaVista?
===================

BellaVista provides researchers with simple means for simultaneous visualization of images, transcripts, and cell/nuclei segmentation boundaries in spatial transcriptomics data.
The interactive tool in Galaxy supports data from multiple platforms including:

* Xenium (10x Genomics)
* MERSCOPE (Vizgen)

What can I visualize with BellaVista?
=====================================

Bellavista can visualize both cell and nuclei segmentation and gene expression pattern over spatial image.

This enables researchers to:

* Visualize spatial gene expression patterns
* Evaluate cell segmentation accuracy
* Validate spatial analysis discoveries

How does it work?
=================

To use this new interactive tool, first create an account in Galaxy and log in with your credentials. Then, you can find in the Tool panel ‚ÄúBellaVista Interactive‚Äù
or go to [this link](https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_bellavista&version=latest). Then select the technology you are using (i.e. MEROSCOPE or Xenium) and
provide images, transcripts and segmentation inputs and click "Run Tool". You can check the status of running ITs [here](https://usegalaxy.eu/interactivetool_entry_points/list).

Acknowledgment
==============

The BellaVista integration into Galaxy was accomplished during the [Galaxy Imaging Hackathon 2025](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2025-04-22-galaxy-imaging-hackathon/) at Freiburg, Germany. We would like to thank all participants and organizers who contributed to this project, making spatial transcriptomics analysis more accessible to the bioinformatics community.

Have a look at the [BelllaVista Documentation](https://bellavista.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

Try it out on **Galaxy** today and explor your spatial data!
