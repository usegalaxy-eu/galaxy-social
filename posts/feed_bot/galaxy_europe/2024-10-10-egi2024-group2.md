üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-10-10-egi2024/

During 1st\-3rd of October, Bj√∂rn Gr√ºning, Mira Kuntz, and Sanjay Kumar Srikakulam from the European Galaxy Team traveled to Lecce to join the [EGI2024 conference](https://www.egi.eu/event/egi2024/) and presented the [EuroScienceGateway project](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) along with collaborators. With Sebasti√°n Luna\-Valero and Enol Fern√°ndez (EGI), Hakan Bayƒ±ndƒ±r (ULAKBIM/TR), ≈Åukasz Dutka (Cyfronet/PL), work packages 1, 3 and 4 of ESG were represented.

At EGI2024, we held a [booth](https://www.egi.eu/article/meet-egi2024-exhibitors-eurosciencegateway/) on Galaxy and usegalaxy.eu, presenting the European Galaxy Server to a broader audience from various scientific fields. We also introduced Galaxy through presentations and presented its opportunities, the ESG project, and its updates. The team also participated in several open meetings and discussions, including the **EGI Federated Cloud community** and the **EGI Trusted Research Environments (TRE) Working Group** sessions.

During the session, Sebastian introduced Galaxy and the ESG project. He presented the ESG architecture, the design, setup, and architecture of Galaxy's EU instance, recent developments in the ESG project, such as Bring Your Own Storage and Bring Your Own Compute, integrations with WLCG IAM and EGI Check\-in, optimized job scheduling and visualization and distributed computing using [PULSAR](https://pulsar-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [ARC](https://arc-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The initiative aims to create an open infrastructure for data\-driven research, focusing on providing a user\-friendly scientific workflow and data integration platform. This endeavor seeks robustness, scalability, and integration, enabling federated computational infrastructures and democratizing research data analysis.

Thank You!
