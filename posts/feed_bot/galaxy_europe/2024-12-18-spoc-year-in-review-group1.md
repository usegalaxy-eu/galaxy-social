📝 New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-12-18-spoc-year-in-review/

🌌 Looking to the Horizon
As SPOC’s starship accelerates toward 2025, we’ll continue to explore new omics territories and deepen our cosmic connections across the Galaxy. Thank you to every SPOC cadet, captain, and commander who contributed this year—you’ve made SPOC the brightest star in the bioinformatics universe!

Keep reaching for the stars, SPOC-nauts! 🪐✨
