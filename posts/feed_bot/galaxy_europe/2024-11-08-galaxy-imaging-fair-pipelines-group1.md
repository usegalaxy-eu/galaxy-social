The Helmholtz Metadata Conference (HMC) 2024
--------------------------------------------

The Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC) focuses on enhancing research
data quality through metadata, implementing this approach throughout the
entire organisation. Its primary goal is to make the extensive research
data produced by Helmholtz Centres findable, accessible, interoperable,
and reusable (FAIR) for the scientific community. This year‚Äôs Helmholtz
Metadata Conference (HMC) was held virtually in Gather Town from November
4th to 6th. The event targeted scientists, data professionals, software developers,
and anyone engaged with metadata. Sessions covered a range of topics,
including metadata management, ontologies, metadata schemas and formats,
semantics, standardisation, and workflows.

Building FAIR Bioimage Pipelines with Galaxy
--------------------------------------------

In the ‚Äúworkflow‚Äù session, I presented the application of Galaxy to develop
FAIR analysis pipelines for metadata annotation and image management in
high\-content screening (HCS) bioimaging. In fact, Galaxy workflows enhance
data FAIRness by allowing annotation, collaboration, and public sharing.
Additionally, Galaxy tools are transparent, meaning they can be easily
inspected within the Galaxy Tool Shed, providing a clear view of their
structure.

Integrating OMERO and Galaxy
----------------------------

During the conference, I discussed integrating OMERO‚Äôs upload and image
annotation features with Galaxy‚Äôs image analysis workflows.
This integration enables images to be automatically enriched with metadata
(e.g., key\-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded
to a user\-defined OMERO server using a new OMERO tool suite developed in
Galaxy. Currently, the suite offers tools for image and ROI uploads,
metadata enrichment, and data filtering or retrieval, making it simple
to transfer data and metadata to an OMERO instance.

Combining Image Processing and Data Management in One Workflow
--------------------------------------------------------------

Image processing can be added to OMERO workflows. Users can retrieve
images from a local server and perform image analyses, such as annotation,
segmentation, or background subtraction. Galaxy is a powerful tool for
image analysis, integrating popular software like CellProfiler and connecting
with cloud services like OMERO and the IDR. This integration allows for
efficient access to and management of image data, which is invaluable in
bioimaging. Automated pipelines streamline the handling of complex metadata,
ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
This approach not only boosts the efficiency of HCS bioimaging but
also aligns with the scientific community‚Äôs FAIR principles, driving
scientific discovery and innovation forward.
