Climate Crisis does not wait for your jobs to finish!
=====================================================

The next global climate strike will be on **Friday, September 20th, 2024**! As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly: the team will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/), if you are nearby join us!
To raise additional awareness in the scientific community, we decided to pause the job queue for a few hours on Friday.
This means that you can still visit our website, but the server will not start new jobs. Running jobs will not be affected.
