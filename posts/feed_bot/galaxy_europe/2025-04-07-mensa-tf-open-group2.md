ü•≥ Mensa Opening at the Technical Faculty!
=========================================

Coming to Freiburg for a lab exchange and planning to visit [**Galaxy Europe (EGD)**](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2025-10-01-egd2025/)?  
Not sure where to grab a quick, affordable bite nearby?

**Fear not ‚Äî your lunch solution has finally arrived!**

After a wait of more than **five years**, the **Mensa at the Technical Faculty**, located *right across from the Galaxy Europe office*, has officially opened its doors today ‚Äî and trust us, it was worth the wait.

We stopped by for the grand pre-opening, and we were **not disappointed**. From tasty meals to super convenient access, this new spot is set to become a lunchtime favorite.

In times of rising food prices and inflation, having an affordable and reliable place to eat makes a real difference ‚Äî especially for employees who don‚Äôt benefit from student discounts. The Mensa offers a solid meal without breaking the bank, just a short walk from your desk.

Not only is it delicious and fast, but it‚Äôll also likely boost **Galaxy Europe's lunchtime productivity** ‚Äî no more long treks or pricey options!

### üí∏ Prices:

* **Students:** ‚Ç¨3.90
* **Employees:** ‚Ç¨5.55
* **Guests:** ‚Ç¨8.50

Hint: **If you find a student or employee the cashier does not mind if you share a card !**
