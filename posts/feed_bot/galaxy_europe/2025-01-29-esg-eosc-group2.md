üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-01-29-esg-eosc/

The [EOSC EU Node](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/) was officially launched in the [EOSC Symposium 2024](https://eosc.eu/symposium2024/) in October in Berlin (Germany). This is the first of a series of upcoming nodes to build the [EOSC Federation](https://eosc.eu/building-the-eosc-federation/). The EOSC EU Node is a platform that primarily supports multi-disciplinary and multi-national research promoting the use of [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data and supplementary services in Europe and beyond.

In January 2025 the [EuroScienceGateway Project](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) participated in the [EOSC Winter School 2025](https://eosc.eu/eosc-focus-project/winter-school-2025/) in Seville (Spain) to share feedback on the use of the EOSC EU Node. In particular we tested the [Virtual Machines](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/services) service to deploy both Galaxy and Pulsar. The video below shows the steps to do it so you can repeat it yourself.

Additional notes to the video above:

1. In order to actually use the services offered by the EOSC EU Node you need to get credits, and you need to be eligible as detailed in the [FAQ](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/support/frequently-asked-questions/user-credits).
2. We are grateful to the support staff of the EOSC EU Node for uploading the [VGCN](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/vgcn) Virtual Machine Image and make it publicly available in the [Virtual Machines](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/services) service so everybody can easily reuse it.

This is all work in progress and we would welcome your feedback to improve it!
