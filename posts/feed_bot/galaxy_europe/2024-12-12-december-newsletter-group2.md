* **ColabFold on Galaxy**: Galaxy now supports ColabFold, enabling ultra-fast **protein structure prediction** by combining MMseqs2 with AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold. This powerful tool splits the process into two streamlined steps: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and AlphaFold2 predictions, offering speed, accuracy, and iterative refinement options‚Äîall within the Galaxy environment.
* **Workflow Comments**: Collaboration within workflows is now easier than ever with the new Workflow Comments feature in the Galaxy Workflow Editor. Add **text comments, markdown explanations, and even freehand drawings** to enhance communication and improve workflow structure and organization.
* **Enhanced Published Workflow Sharing**: Sharing workflows has been revolutionized with a redesigned Published Workflow Sharing page. The updated layout includes a read-only mode, an embedded interactive editor view, and improved responsiveness, making it more straightforward for users to **share, navigate, and collaborate on workflows**.
* **Seamless InvenioRDM Integration**: Galaxy now integrates directly with InvenioRDM, allowing users to **import files** from InvenioRDM repositories into Galaxy and **publish Galaxy records** (like Histories and datasets) to InvenioRDM. This integration streamlines data import/export processes, offering greater flexibility and efficiency.
* **Activity Bar Enabled by Default**: The Activity Bar is now enabled by default, providing users with **quick access to essential features** and improving overall workflow navigation.
* **Workflow Invocation Graph View**: The new **graph view** in the workflow invocation summary clearly represents job states for each workflow step. Clicking on a step reveals detailed information, **improving monitoring and troubleshooting** capabilities.
* **Zenodo Integration**: The Zenodo file source plugin simplifies integration with Zenodo and Invenio repositories. New schemes (`invenio://` and `zenodo://`) enhance alignment with these platforms while maintaining support for existing exports using `gxfiles://`.

These updates are a testament to Galaxy‚Äôs commitment to improving user experience, enhancing collaboration, and supporting seamless data sharing. We‚Äôre excited to see how the community uses these new features to advance their research and workflows!
