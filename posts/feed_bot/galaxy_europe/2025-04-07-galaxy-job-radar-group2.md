üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-04-07-galaxy-job-radar/

The Galaxy Project offers invaluable support to scientists and researchers, but its inner workings can be complex and lack visual appeal, potentially deterring many prospective users. To bridge this gap, I've started developing a project entitled **Galaxy Job Radar**, designed to dynamically visualize the current and past computations within the Galaxy system. This tool also provides significant advantages to Galaxy administrators by offering insights into computational maintenance and potential threats across the network.

My name is **Tomas Vondrak**, and I am working on the **Galaxy Job Radar** as part of my Master's thesis at **CESNET** in the Czech Republic, while studying theoretical computer science at **Masaryk University in Brno**.

Currently, **Galaxy Job Radar** can visualize the live status of running and queued jobs on **Pulsar interfaces connected to its Galaxy server and other computational resources**. It also includes the ability to **replay recent computations**. Currently all available data is fetched from the **InfluxDB** database of the Galaxy node. The project is still **under development**, and we are actively collaborating with European Galaxy node administrators to access more data from internal Galaxy database. Our goal is to design this tool so that every Galaxy admin can easily integrate Galaxy Job Radar into their systems.

Data Collection for Galaxy Job Radar
------------------------------------

The primary data source for Galaxy Job Radar is the InfluxDB database, which is populated with data from the internal Galaxy Database. **Galaxy administrators can configure data transfer from their Galaxy instances to InfluxDB using the Telegraf project**. Currently, we are utilizing data from the European Galaxy node, but we anticipate expanding the Galaxy Job Radar to other instances in the future. Additionally, there are plans to support multiple Galaxies with a single Galaxy Job Radar instance, offering a comprehensive view of computations across the Galaxy ecosystem.

Example and Repository
----------------------

**A live instance of Galaxy Job Radar is available at [gjr.metacentrum.cz](https://gjr.metacentrum.cz)** and its source code can be accessed on GitHub at [CESNET/gjr](https://github.com/CESNET/gjr).

Future Prospects
----------------

Looking ahead, we plan numerous enhancements for Galaxy Job Radar, ensuring the security and anonymity of Galaxy users. Our aim is to make Galaxy more visually appealing to users and provide a clearer view of their running tasks.
For computational resource administrators running their Pulsar interfaces, we plan to implement graphs detailing resource efficiency in job scheduling over time, and for Galaxy administrators, insights into system-wide job scheduling performance. These features will be crucial for optimizing the Galaxy scheduling system, as outlined in [this Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/14936846).

I am optimistic about the swift progression of **Galaxy Job Radar** and its imminent integration into the Galaxy ecosystem!
