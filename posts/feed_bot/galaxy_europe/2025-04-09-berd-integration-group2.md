üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-04-09-berd-integration/

[Berd4NFDI](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/about/) is a NFDI consortia working towards a platform for collecting, (pre-)processing, analyzing and preserving Business, Economic and Related Data.
Their [BERD Data Portal](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/data-portal/) is a hub for unstructured and structured academic data based on invenioRDM.
As such, we made the portal's datasets available to browse directly in Galaxy.
That means you can open Galaxy, upload your dataset and start analysing it directly.

![Screenshot of the BERD Data Portal Folder in Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-04-09-berd-integration/BERD_Galaxy.png "Browse the BERD Data Portal within Galaxy")

For that, go to https://usegalaxy.eu/, make an account and log in. Click on the left hand side and click on 'Upload'.
A new window opens. Click on the button 'Choose from repository'. In the upcoming window, insert "BERD" in the search bar.
Now you can click on the folder "BERD@NFDI Repository". The datasets from BERD's portal show up here. You can select any folder to see its content. To choose one, click on the item or items you and click on the 'Select' button in the corner.
Click on 'Start' and close this window.

Once the file on the right side, the history, goes from grey (waiting) to orange (processing) to green, your upload is finished.
In the next steps, you can analyse your data in Galaxy with various tools according to your needs, make visualisation and also export your findings to a repository of your choice, including to BERD if you like :). All from within Galaxy.
For example try [Openrefine](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=interactive_tool_openrefine), our [word-cloud](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/wordcloud/wordcloud/1.9.4+galaxy1) tool or any of
our table manipulation or machine learning / AI tools.
