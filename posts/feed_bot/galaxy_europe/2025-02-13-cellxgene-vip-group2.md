üìù New blog post Released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-02-13-cellxgene-vip/

CELLxGENE-VIP (Visualization In Plugin) is an extension of the original [CELLxGENE](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) tool developed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
It can efficiently extract deep insights from single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and emerging multiome datasets.

* It generates a comprehensive set of over eighteen commonly used quality control and analytical plots in high resolution with highly customizable settings.
* It provides more advanced analytical functions to gain insights into cellular compositions and deep biology, such as marker gene identification, differential gene expression analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis.
* It pioneers methods to visualize multi-modal data, such as spatial transcriptomics embedding aligned with histological images and the latest 10x Genomic Multiome dataset.
