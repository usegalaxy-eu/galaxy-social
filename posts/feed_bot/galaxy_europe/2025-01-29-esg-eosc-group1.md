Nearly a year ago, the EuroScienceGateway (ESG) project achieved an important milestone: deploying Galaxy + Pulsar on the EOSC EU Node â€” a major step toward a federated, FAIR, and reusable scientific infrastructure in Europe.

This work demonstrated how researchers could easily launch their own Galaxy instances on the European Open Science Cloud, bringing reproducibility and scalability closer to everyday practice.

As 2025 continues to advance open science initiatives, this achievement deserves another look. Building sustainable, interoperable research platforms is a long game â€” and ESGâ€™s contribution remains a key example of collaboration done right.
