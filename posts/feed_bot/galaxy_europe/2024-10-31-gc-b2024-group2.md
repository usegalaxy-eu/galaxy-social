The [German Conference of Bioinformatics (GCB) 2024](https://gcb2024.de/) took place in Bielefeld from September 30 to October 2, bringing together leading minds in bioinformatics to discuss the latest advancements in computational biology, microbiome research, genomics, and more. Representing the Galaxy community, Engy Nasr and Saim Momin attended, contributing with two poster presentations and participating in workshops, poster sessions, and stimulating talks. Here‚Äôs a recap of our experience and the conference highlights.

### Day 1: Hands\-on Workshops

Our GCB 2024 journey began with two in\-depth workshops, where we gained valuable insights and skills in specialized areas of bioinformatics. With seven workshops running in parallel, we joined the following two sessions:

1. **Computational Pangenomics Workshop:** This workshop covered pangenomics fundamentals, with applications in analyzing genetic diversity across species. We explored advanced computational tools for building and analyzing pangenomic datasets, including *PanBench*, *PanGrowth*, *Plast*, *Bifrost*, and *SANS*. The hands\-on exercises illuminated new ways to use pangenomic analysis within the Galaxy framework.
2. **Standardizing and Harmonizing NGS Analysis Workflows:** Organized by experts from GHGA and universities across Germany, this workshop focused on the need for standardization in Next\-Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflows. We learned how the FAIR principles are applied within the German Human Genome\-Phenome Archive (GHGA) to harmonize nf\-core\-based workflows, covering reproducibility, adaptability, and scalability in various computational environments. The session included hands\-on exercises where we managed workflows using *Nextflow* and *nf\-core* with local and cloud settings configurations, highlighting the importance of standardized, FAIR data\-sharing practices in international research.

### Keynotes, Conference Sessions, and Poster Interactions

Across the two main conference days, a mix of talks, poster sessions, and networking opportunities enriched our knowledge. Highlights included keynote talks from prominent researchers and experts in bioinformatics and genomic sciences, tackling issues in microbiome data integration, large\-scale clinical data analysis, and applications in environmental science. We found sessions on data standardization, open\-source workflows, and community\-driven research especially pertinent.

The poster sessions, featuring 158 posters, were a lively exchange of ideas. Presenting our work and discussing it with colleagues across bioinformatics sparked new perspectives on data standards, reproducibility, and community collaboration.

### Galaxy Team Poster Presentations

Our Galaxy team contributed two posters, both well\-received and served as excellent opportunities for discussion:

* **microGalaxy SIG: Microbial Data Analysis Resources in Galaxy**  

This poster highlighted Galaxy's resources for microbial data analysis, outlining workflows and tools designed for complex microbial data sets. We connected with microbiome researchers, discussing ways Galaxy can continue to support and adapt to microbial data needs.
* **Community\-Driven Standards Development for Reference Genome Generation**  

This poster addressed the collaborative efforts of Galaxy EU and [ERGA](https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) community to establish community\-driven standards for reference genome generation. The feedback underscored the importance of ongoing community involvement in developing adaptable, high\-standard open\-source tools and workflows.

### Social Program: Networking and Cultural Highlights

Beyond the enriching scientific exchange, GCB 2024‚Äôs social program added a unique flavor to the event. We attended a networking dinner at the [GL√úCKUNDSELIGKEIT restaurant](https://gcb2024.de/Social+Programme.html), complete with guided tours of the Bielefeld city, followed by a delightful dinner reception. Conversations flowed easily, sparking ideas for future collaborations within the bioinformatics community. These informal exchanges gave us the chance to connect with peers, gain insights into their work, and share our own experiences working within the Galaxy ecosystem.

### Reflections and Takeaways

Attending GCB 2024 was an inspiring experience for our team, marked by learning, collaboration, and cultural discovery. The breadth of topics‚Äîfrom pangenomics to community standards in genome generation‚Äîbroadened our understanding of current bioinformatics challenges and innovations. We left with renewed enthusiasm for advancing Galaxy‚Äôs contributions to bioinformatics and are grateful to the organizers, speakers, and participants who made this event both insightful and memorable.

Looking forward to future collaborations with the dynamic GCB community!
