Tool suites may appear in multiple clusters, as they can be annotated with several topics. A logarithmic scale is applied for improved visualization.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usegalaxy-eu/galaxy-social/2025-01-07-microgalaxy-preprint/posts/images/2025-01-07-microgalaxy-preprint-supp-figure-3-a.png)


(B) Usage trends show increasing adoption of microGalaxy tools over time.

🔍 How does microGalaxy compare?

We reviewed 44 microbial data analysis platforms, comparing:

    General characteristics (e.g., free/open-source)
    Accessibility (e.g., user-friendly interfaces, automatable APIs)
    Supported methods (e.g., taxonomy profiling, MAGs, multi-omics)

📊 See Supplementary Table 1 for full comparisons!


 

microGalaxy wouldn’t exist without our amazing global community!

From tool developers to educators, this is a testament to the power of collaboration in bioinformatics.

Big thanks to everyone who made this possible! 🙏
