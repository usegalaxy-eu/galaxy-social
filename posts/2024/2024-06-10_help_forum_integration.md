Linking from Galaxy tool forms to the Galaxy Help Forum, https://help.galaxyproject.org/, was first discussed at the European Galaxy days at @unifreiburg@bawÃ¼.social last autumn.
Since then @ElectronicBlueberry@chaosfem.tw from our team has implemented the new functionality, which has become part of the last Galaxy release.  
We believe that the help forum integration is a wonderful addition to Galaxy tool forms with great potential to reduce friction in tool use, and are very happy to be able to offer it to our users on #GalaxyEurope.

Huge thanks to @ElectronicBlueberry@chaosfem.tw for not just implementing the feature, but for also writing about it:

If you haven't discovered the feature yet, check out the blog post for what to expect, while we are working on tagging additional help forum content to bring it to the forms of more and more tools.

Thanks also to all users who, over the years, have taken the time to turn their tool and analysis questions into help forum contributions. Your extra efforts help us help the community and are very much appreciated ðŸ’–
