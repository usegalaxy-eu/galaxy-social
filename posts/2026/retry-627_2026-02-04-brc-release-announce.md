We are pleased to announce a new release of https://BRC-Analytics.org (v0.20.0). This release updates the number of included organisms to 1900+ with 5000+ assemblies, and over 400 assemblies getting gene track data mirrored from VEuPathDB.org.


Additionally, we've added a "Learn" section with several FAQs and HOWTOs along with a few white papers demonstrating the use of BRC-Analytics.org, one looking at evolutionary dynamics in measles and another using AI to standardize RNA-Seq analysis in C. auris.


Of course, if you have organisms/assemblies you'd like to see added, or have suggestions about funtionality, let us know!
