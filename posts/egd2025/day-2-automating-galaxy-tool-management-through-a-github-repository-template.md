On Day 2 of European Galaxy Days, Martin Cech presented 'Automating Galaxy Tool Management Through a GitHub Repository Template'.
He also mentioned the upcoming Galaxy Admin Training in Brno.

Everyone who participated in last year’s GCC can attest that Brno is a very nice location, and the Galaxy Europe team can confirm that it’s quite accessible by train (either via Prague or Vienna).
